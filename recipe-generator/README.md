# Intelligent Recipe Generator

## Overview

The Intelligent Recipe Generator is an AI system that will automatically generate recipes customized to the user's needs and preferences. The user can provide an input query specifying desired ingredients, constraints like time or equipment available, or a specific type of dish. The system will then output a complete recipe including ingredients, instructions, approximate time, required tools and equipment, and an image of the final dish generated via AI image generation.

## Features

- Natural language interface - Users can query the system using natural phrases like "quick chicken curry recipe" or "vegetarian dishes with lentils". The system will parse the intent and key parameters from this text.
- Ingredient/equipment awareness - The system will build and maintain user ingredient and equipment profiles. Recipes generated will match what the user has available. It can suggest new recipes they can make with ingredients on hand.
- Customization - The system adapts the recipes to the user's tastes and cooking skill level. A beginning cook may get simpler recipes with more details while an expert gets challenging ones.
- Personalized recommendations - Based on the user profile, the system can suggest new recipes to try, ingredients to buy, or equipment that would enable more recipe options.
- Step-by-step instructions - The generated recipes include complete preparations steps, advice for tricky techniques, and estimates for cooking time.
- AI-generated images - Each recipe is accompanied by an appetizing image of the final dish generated using AI image generation models like DALL-E.

## Implementation

The system will leverage large databases of recipes and ingredients to select, combine, and adapt recipes to meet the user's query. Neural networks will generate recipe steps and images. User profiles will be stored to enable personalization.

The front-end interface will be a chatbot that takes in natural language queries and outputs recipe cards with text and generated images. The back-end will use Python along with frameworks like TensorFlow and databases like MongoDB.

## Objective

The Intelligent Recipe Generator will provide a convenient and customizable cooking assistant that learns users' preferences and suggests personalized recipes optimized for the ingredients they have on hand. This project combines AI techniques like natural language processing, recommendation systems, and generative models to create an innovative and useful product for home cooks.
