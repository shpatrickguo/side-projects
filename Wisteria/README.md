# Wisteria

Aimed to help guilds manage their members guild battle damage in Cookie Run Kingdom. Instead of manually typing damage numbers from screenshots to excel. This program processes the images submitted by guild members of their damage performance on each guild battle boss and extracts their damage numbers, then exports into `.csv` for record keeping.

## Instructions for `dmgCheck.py`

Drag screenshots of user into their directory then run `dmgCheck.py`.
Output should be `.csv` files in  `report/`

Remember to update the SEASON variable
